Compilation of Python Programming projects
# Project 1 - Analysing TV Data:
* Loaded, cleaned, then explored Super Bowl game, television, and halftime show data. 
* Visualized the distributions of combined points, point differences, and halftime show performances using histograms.
* Used line plots to see how ad cost increases lagged behind viewership increases.
* Discovered that blowouts do appear to lead to a drop in viewers.
# Projec 2 - 
* Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as children’s movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we can’t know for certain until we perform additional analyses.
Congratulations, you’ve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas. This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas.
